### RESULTS ###


[36] loci matched the species character states


"True" hemiplasy (1 mutation) occurs [21] time(s)


Combinations of hemiplasy and homoplasy (1 < # mutations < 5) occur [15] time(s)


"True" homoplasy (>= 5 mutations) occurs [0] time(s)


[36] loci have a discordant gene tree

[0] loci are concordant with the species tree


[0] loci originate from an introgressed history

[36] loci originate from the species history
