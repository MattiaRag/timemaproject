### RESULTS ###

56 loci matched the species character states

"True" hemiplasy (1 mutation) occurs 2 time(s)

Combinations of hemiplasy and homoplasy (1 < # mutations < 5) occur 2 time(s)

"True" homoplasy (>= 5 mutations) occurs 10 time(s)

56 loci have a discordant gene tree
0 loci are concordant with the species tree

0 loci originate from an introgressed history
56 loci originate from the species history

Distribution of mutation counts:

# Mutations	# Trees
