### RESULTS ###


[0] loci matched the species character states


"True" hemiplasy (1 mutation) occurs [0] time(s)


Combinations of hemiplasy and homoplasy (1 < # mutations < 5) occur [0] time(s)


"True" homoplasy (>= 5 mutations) occurs [0] time(s)


[0] loci have a discordant gene tree

[0] loci are concordant with the species tree


[0] loci originate from an introgressed history

[0] loci originate from the species history


Distribution of mutation counts:


# Mutations	# Trees

On all trees:

1		[0]

2		[0]

3		[0]

4		[0]


On concordant trees:

Origins of mutations leading to observed character states for hemiplasy + homoplasy cases:


	Tip mutation	Internal branch mutation	Tip reversal
