# Experimental design explanation


This project tests alternative hypothesis to convergence, for parthenogenesis evolution in *Timema* stick insects. 

Specifically, we aim at:



**1.** testing the occurance of hemiplasic patterns along the species tree of *Timema* and for each tree of that genes possibly involved in reproduction and/or ovogenesis;


**2.** testing the possibility of parthenogenesis as ancestral state for reproduction in *Timema*, contrary to what was believed till now (bisexuality as ancestral state). 





To test the **first hypothesis**, we adopted two approaches:



**[1](https://github.com/MattiaRag/timemaproject/blob/main/markdowns/part_1.md)**  -  an inference-based approach involving the use of [HeIST](https://github.com/lhugolach/HeIST?tab=readme-ov-file), a tool able to make statistical inferences about the probability of hemiplasy and homoplasy in large datasets that possibly contain both ILS and introgression;


**[2](https://github.com/MattiaRag/timemaproject/blob/main/markdowns/part_2.md)**  -  an approach based on the detection of hemiplasic candidate genes, inferring the probability of hemiplasy of each orthogroup and corresponding gene tree, and performing a gene ontology and gene enrichment analyses.

 



To test the **second hypothesis**, we performed two different analyses:



**[3](https://github.com/MattiaRag/timemaproject/blob/main/markdowns/part_3.md)**  -  an Ancestral State Recostruction (ASR) based on an ultrametric tree and the trait state for each species;


**[4](https://github.com/MattiaRag/timemaproject/blob/main/markdowns/part_4.md)**  -  the inference of probability, for parthenogenetic species, to undergo fewer changes than bisexual species.
