# Experimental design


*aim:* understand experimental design


This project tests alternative hypothesis to convergence, for parthenogenesis evolution in *Timema* stick insects. 
Specifically, we aim at:


1. testing the occurance of hemiplasic patterns along the species tree of *Timema* and for each tree of that genes possibly involved in reproduction and/or ovogenesis;
2. testing the possibility of parthenogenesis as ancestral state for reproduction in *Timema*, contrary to what was believed till now (bisexuality as ancestral state). 


To do so we 


1. two different tissue (haead+thorax and abdomen) and four different conditions were considered for crema:


**A**  -  never got in contact with vicia

**B**  -  got in contact with vicia only since 24h before experiment

**C**  -  got in contact with vicia only until 24h before experiment 

**D**  -  got in contact with vicia continuously


2. nectarium of vicia which:

**N**  -  never got in contact with crema

**Y**  -  2' after beeing visited by crema
