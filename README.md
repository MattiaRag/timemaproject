**Significance** – onvergent evolution, or parallelism, refers to the acquisition of similar phenotypes independently, playing a crucial role in understanding evolutionary processes. Seeking convergence in a trait that evolved once and was subsequently inherited would lead to erroneous conclusions, as similarities observed stem from the same trait rather than indicative of a broader evolutionary pattern. Here we revised one of the more iconic cases of parallel evolution, the evolution of parthenogenesis in _Timema_ stick insects. There are two scenarios regarding the evolution of parthenogenesis in _Timema_ which would imply a reconsideration of previous interpretation: either it evolved once through Incomplete Lineage Sorting (ILS), or parthenogenesis was the ancestral state.

**Abstract** – Traits that evolve independently multiple times are crucial for understanding the mechanisms of evolution, as they are often thought to result from similar or identical mutations in unrelated lineages. The _Timema_ genus comprises five obligate parthenogenetic species of stick insects, each in sister relationship with a bisexually reproducing species. The current literature states bisexuality as the ancestral state for this clade, with parthenogenesis having evolved five times, independently. In this study, we investigate the alternative hypothesis of parthenogenesis either evolving once or being the ancestral condition in each of the lineages. The first hypothesis proposes that parthenogenesis evolved just once, and its taxonomic distribution could be explained by hemiplasy, a process leading to discordance between trait and species trees caused by incomplete lineage sorting or introgression. We tested this using both inference-based approaches and by identifying hemiplastic candidate genes, which we characterized using gene ontology analyses. The second hypothesis suggests that parthenogenesis was the ancestral state, with bisexuality being the derived one. We explored this hypothesis through two lines of research: the different probability of relative rate of shifts in sexual strategies from parthenogenetic to bisexual, and proteomic analyses showing fewer changes in parthenogenetic taxa compared to their bisexual sister, suggesting bisexuality as derived trait. Our findings illustrate how traits appearing as evolutionary novelties may be built on ancestral ground, and highlight the potential for misinterpreting evolution due to misleading inferences.
