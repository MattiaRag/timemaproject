**Abstract** – Traits that have evolved independently multiple times in different lineages are crucial for understanding evolutionary processes, as they are often thought to result from shared solutions or constraints. However, similar phenotypic outcomes can result from shared ancestry rather than independent evolutionary events. This study focuses on the Timema genus of insects, which includes five pairs of gonochoric and parthenogenetic sister species. Traditional views hold that sexual reproduction is ancestral in this clade, with parthenogenesis arising five times independently. We challenge this view by testing two alternative hypotheses: that parthenogenesis was the ancestral condition in the genus or evolved fewer times than the number of parthenogenetic lineages. The first hypothesis posits that sexual reproduction is a derived trait, with parthenogens inheriting their reproductive strategy from the most recent common ancestor of Timema. Our analyses reveal that parthenogens have accumulated significantly fewer changes than gonochoric species, and ancestral state reconstructions show substantial uncertainty regarding the reproductive strategy of the most recent common ancestor of Timema. The second hypothesis posits that parthenogenesis evolved fewer than five times, with its distribution explained by hemiplasy - a process resulting in the evolution of a trait along a gene tree discordant with the species tree. Inference-based approaches support a scenario where parthenogenesis evolved only once. However, we did not find any gene present in all Timema species supporting a single origin of parthenogenesis; however, genes supporting a partially hemiplasic scenario show functional connections to potential parthenogenetic mechanisms. Here, we provide an example showing that what can be interpreted as the results of independent evolutionary processes may instead be rooted in ancestral traits and polymorphism. This research underscores the importance of critically evaluating competing hypotheses when interpreting patterns of repeated evolution.

**Significance** – In evolutionary biology, it’s common to find similar traits appearing in different species, which can lead to the assumption that these traits evolved independently. However, these traits might instead be inherited from a common ancestor. Our study revisited this idea by examining Timema stick insects, which include sexually reproducing and asexually reproducing species. Traditionally, it is believed that parthenogenetic reproduction evolved independently five times within Timema. Our research challenges this view by exploring the possibility that parthenogenesis might have been present in their common ancestor or evolved fewer times than previously thought. On the one hand, our analyses did not find solid support for a Timema most recent common ancestor with separate sexes, implying that it might have been a parthenogen nonetheless. On the other hand, we found evidence that parthenogenesis may have evolved on a tree discordant with the species tree, due to phenomena such as incomplete lineage sorting. This study highlights the possibility that similar phenotypical endpoints might be generated through more complex evolutionary histories than repeated evolution.
