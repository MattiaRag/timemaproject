**Significance** – Evolution often surprises us with traits that reappear across different species, a phenomenon known as repeated evolution. This can suggest that species find similar solutions to common challenges or face shared constraints. However, these traits may sometimes be inherited from a shared ancestor, leading to possible misinterpretations. This study focuses on a fascinating case: the Timema genus of stick insects, which includes species that reproduce sexually (gonochoric) and others that reproduce asexually (parthenogenetic). Traditionally, it was believed that parthenogenesis evolved five separate times within Timema, but our research explored alternative explanations. We tested two main hypotheses: first, that parthenogenesis might be the original reproductive strategy of the genus, implying that sexual reproduction evolved multiple times as a derived trait. Second, we considered that parthenogenesis might have evolved fewer than five times, with its current distribution resulting from genetic processes such as hemiplasy. Hemiplasy occurs when a trait evolves along a gene tree that does not match the overall species tree, creating a scattered distribution of the trait across related species. Using genomic data, we reconstructed the evolutionary history of Timema and compared genetic changes between parthenogenetic and gonochoric sister species. Unexpectedly, we found that parthenogenetic species had accumulated fewer genetic changes over time than their sexual counterparts. This suggests that parthenogenesis may be older than previously thought and could have been present in the common ancestor of the genus. Additionally, some genetic evidence supported the idea that parthenogenesis evolved fewer than five times, hinting at a more complex evolutionary pattern involving ancestral genetic variation. This study emphasizes the importance of re-examining evolutionary patterns, as what appears to be independent evolution may sometimes reflect inherited traits and shared ancestry. Moreover, it highlights the value of using robust analytical methods to distinguish between true repeated evolution and ancestral characteristics. 

**Abstract** – Traits that have evolved independently multiple times in different lineages are crucial for understanding evolutionary processes, as they are often thought to result from shared solutions or constraints. However, similar phenotypic outcomes can result from shared ancestry rather than independent evolutionary events. This study focuses on the Timema genus of insects, which includes five pairs of gonochoric and parthenogenetic sister species. Traditional views hold that sexual reproduction is ancestral in this clade, with parthenogenesis arising five times independently. We challenge this view by testing two alternative hypotheses: that parthenogenesis was the ancestral condition in the genus or evolved fewer times than the number of parthenogenetic lineages. The first hypothesis posits that sexual reproduction is a derived trait, with parthenogens inheriting their reproductive strategy from the most recent common ancestor of Timema. Our analyses reveal that parthenogens have accumulated significantly fewer changes than gonochoric species, and ancestral state reconstructions show substantial uncertainty regarding the reproductive strategy of the most recent common ancestor of Timema. The second hypothesis posits that parthenogenesis evolved fewer than five times, with its distribution explained by hemiplasy - a process resulting in the evolution of a trait along a gene tree discordant with the species tree. Inference-based approaches support a scenario where parthenogenesis evolved only once. However, we did not find any gene present in all Timema species supporting a single origin of parthenogenesis; however, genes supporting a partially hemiplasic scenario show functional connections to potential parthenogenetic mechanisms. Here, we provide an example showing that what can be interpreted as the results of independent evolutionary processes may instead be rooted in ancestral traits and polymorphism. This research underscores the importance of critically evaluating competing hypotheses when interpreting patterns of repeated evolution.
