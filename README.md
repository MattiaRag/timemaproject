**Significance** – Convergent evolution, or parallelism, refers to the acquisition of similar phenotypes independently, playing a crucial role in understanding evolutionary processes. Seeking convergence in a trait that evolved once and was subsequently inherited would lead to erroneous conclusions, as similarities observed stem from the same trait rather than indicative of a broader evolutionary pattern. Here we revised one of the more iconic cases of parallel evolution, the evolution of parthenogenesis in _Timema insects_. There are two scenarios regarding the evolution of parthenogenesis in Timema which would imply a reconsideration of previous interpretation: either it evolved once through Incomplete Lineage Sorting (ILS), or parthenogenesis was the ancestral state.
